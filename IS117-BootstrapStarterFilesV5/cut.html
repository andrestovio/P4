    <p><br>Cutting the healthy is quite a challenge and some individuals tend to do it the wrong way. You may confuse it with being insecure and attempting to lose as much as weight as possible by not eating. This is bad and makes your digestive system tighter. Instead, what you should do is consume healthy food in small portions. This would mean that you are not skipping an entire meal. In addition, cutting is highly recommend when an individual has high body fat percentage.</br> <br> First, we need to separate the disctint types of food such as proteins, fats, legumes, carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, and beverages.</br> <br>You wake up hungry and debating whether to get a plate of food or to fast instead. The answer is to eat therefore breakfast is known to be one of the most if not the important meal of the day. For breakfast, you should have 4 scrambled egg whites, 2 slices wholemeal toast = Ham, mushroom and spinach frittata. Another breakfast combination is smoothie with banana, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, water + hone</br> <br>Once again, do not skip a meal. Lunch is around the corner and you should have small amounts of chicken, brown rice and broccoli. Another lunch combination is a chicken wrap with tomatoes, cucumber, olives and hummus.</br> <br> Last but not least, dinner is your last meal of the day. A great meal can be small amount tuna steak, two sweet potatoes, broccoli and asparagus. Another dinner combination can be beef stir-fry with brown rice </p>
