    <p><br>Bulking the healthy way is quite a challenge, but it is not impossible. Only you know yourself more than others, so set realistic goals. Be aware of the food you are consuming and the nutrition facts. The key to complete a healthy bulk is by consuming more calories than what you burn. Since you want to complete this in a healthy matter, you will gain muscles if done correctly.</br> <br>First, we need to separate the disctint types of food such as proteins, fats, legumes, carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, and beverages.</br> <br> A typical breakfast should contain a minimum of each food of five eggs, one cup of dry oats, one banana, and one cup of whole milk. Another meal combination for breakfast is a minimum of each food is five eggs, two medium sweet potatoes, one diced medium onion, and eight ounces of lean ground turkey.</br> <br> Moving forward with lunch, a typical would contain three pieces chicken breast, 1/3 of an avocado, 100 grams of raw spinach, and seven grams of rice. Another meal combination would be eight ounces of salmon fillet, four pieces of sweet potato, one cup of broccoli, and two tablespoons of sesame seeds.</br> <br> Last but not least, moving on with dinner. A typical meal with this contain nine ounces Sirloin steak, two cups of mashed potato, two cups of cooked spinach, two cups of grilled mushrooms, and a fried egg. Another dinner combination can be 50 grams of lean minced meatballs, three cups of pasta and Bolognese sauce.  </br> </p>
